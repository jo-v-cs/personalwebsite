# Personal website

### What is this?

This is a personal website I am building to display my future projects. It includes a landing page, a page with a brief biography about me, a (future) portfolio page, a contact page, and an additional pages with some miscellaneous content.


### Code Louisville Project Implemented Features:

**Media Queries**:
The two media queries can be best viewed on the "portfolio.html" page (accessible from "index.html" via the navigation bar).

  - Medium screen (>= 800px width): Switch from single column to double column layout on portfolio display
  - Large screen (>= 1020px width): Switch from the hamburger-style navigation bar to a fixed list

**CSS Features**: 
  - Hamburger-style navigation menu that opens/closes when the hamburger icon is selected.
  - CSS Flexbox is used to align and display items in the top bar as well as the main content of each page.


**JavaScript Feature**: 
  - Hamburger-style navigation menu is implemented with JavaScript. 
  - "contact.html" - contact form name is captured and a message is printed in the html body of the page thanking the user by name for submitting their contact information and message.
